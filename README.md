Scripts 1-3 are lab tasks, script process_controller.sh is my own idea.

process_controller allows you to save a list of all currently active processes. Later you can select the option to show changes - it lists all processes that have been opened or closed after the save was created. Then you can load the save, restoring the system state from your save.
